## Welcome to Your Lab Adventure!

### Overview
In this session, we’ve designed 15 unique labs for you to explore, grouped into 4 distinct tracks to create a focused and engaging learning experience. Each track is crafted to help you develop specific skills.

Here’s what you need to know:

  > Each track offers a different number of labs, guiding you through a cohesive learning journey.
  >
  > Completing just one track is enough to achieve the session’s goals.
  > 
  > Want to push further? Finish 2 tracks to excel, 3 tracks to become an expert, or take on all 4 tracks to earn the ultimate title of Mega Superstar!
  >
  > Take a moment to review the tracks, choose the ones that excite you, and dive in. This is your adventure—make it unforgettable!

There’s no set order—start with any track that interests you most, but we recommend starting with the **Core Track**. One of the missions contains information you are going to use on the final troubleshooting task, which we will complete as the last mission.
