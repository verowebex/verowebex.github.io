# Mission 3: Seamless AI to Human Agent Handoffs

> !!! Note
      This task relies on completing Mission 2 of the AI Track. Ensure that mission is completed to have a fully functional AI Scripted Agent feature in the Contact Center.

## Story

This lab is designed to explore how to pass contextual intelligence from AI Agents to Webex Contact Center agents. It involves leveraging AI Summaries for Webex AI  agent conversational transcripts . By completing this lab, you will gain practical skills and knowledge on how to provide the right context to agents to better handle customer queries.


## Call Flow Overview
1. A new call enters the flow.
2. The AI Agent engages with the caller by asking pre-configured questions.
3. The AI Agent gathers all necessary details and hands the call back to the flow.
4. The flow utilizes the last identified intent to route the call appropriately.

## Mission Details

Your mission is to:

1. Configure a smooth handoff to live human agent from AI Agent.
2. Modify Virtual Agent transcript
3. Configure routing based on last used intent
4. Use AI Assistant

## Build

### Transfer to Human Agent

### Checkpoint: Last Intent Based Routing
    
1. Make sure your agent is **Available** and if not, login to you Desktop as explained in previous Quick Test (see above)
2. Make a call to your test number. During your interaction with the Virtual Agent start requesting for an appointment and then request a transfer to a live agent by saying, **"Please transfer me to an Agent."** If the last intent was "Book appointment", you will hear the Text-to-Speech message: **"Routing to an agent skilled at booking an appointment."**. 

    <!-- md:option type:note -->
    
    !!! note "Sample Conversation"
        "I would like to Book  an appointment"
    
        What date are you considering for your visit 
    
        "Feb 20th"
    
        Could tell us preferred time for your visit 
    
        "3PM"
    
        Which doctor you want appointment with
      
        "Dr John"
    
        What is name of the  patience 
    
        "Peter<any name>"
    
        Could you tell us patience Date of Birth
    
        "Please transfer me to an agent "

3. Answer the call on the agent desktop when it rings.
4. End the call and go back to your flow and click on **Analyze** tab at the bottom of the canvas. Observe the last call behavior.
5. Open Debug tool and open your last call. Click on **VA_Metadata** which is our renames Set Variable. See that metadata from **VirtualAgentV2_<*>.MetaData** was written into **vameta** flow variable we created on **Step 3**.
  ![profiles](../graphics/Lab2/L2M4_Handoff_Analyze&Debug.gif)

6. Copy JSON from debugger and paste it into [https://jsonpath.com/](https://jsonpath.com/){:target="_blank"} inputs.
7. Change Debug mode to Design in Flow Designer and copy the path from Parse node into JSONPath of the [https://jsonpath.com/](https://jsonpath.com/){:target="_blank"}. You should get last intent name as "Book Apppointement"

### Checkpoint: AI assistant
1. Click on the AI assistant icon located on the top right navigation pane in Agent Desktop.

    ![profiles](../graphics/Lab2/L2M4_checkAIIcon.gif)

2. Dial the support number assigned to your **<span class="attendee-id-container"><span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-suffix="_Channel">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_Channel<span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>** and initiate a conversation with below

3. During the interaction with the virtual Agent, request a transfer by saying, **"Please transfer me to an Agent."** Answer the call on the agent desktop upon receiving the ring notification.

4. Observe that, after answering the call, a summary of the Virtual Agent interaction is now displayed on the agent desktop
