# Mission 4: Routing Returning Callers

!!! Note
    We are intentionally adding a bit of complexity to this lab by removing GIFs and screenshots. This approach will help you gain a deeper understanding of how to build and configure Webex Contact Center logic.
    If you encounter any difficulties while configuring steps in this mission, feel free to ask one of the instructors for assistance.


## Story
When a customer calls back into the contact center within ten minutes of their last call ending, we can assume there was a dropped call, missed callback, or they need additional assistance from their last interaction.  We are going to prioritize their call in the queue so that they can finish their business.

## Call Flow Overview

1. New call comes into the flow</br>
2. Call the Search API to check if the ANI (caller's number) had a call which ended in the last 10 minutes.</br>
3. If the caller had a connected call which ended within the last 10 minutes, we will play a message and will queue the call with a higher priority so they will get assigned to the next available agent.</br>
4. If the caller did not end a call with the contact center in the previous 10 minutes, we will queue the call normally.</br>

## Mission Details

Your mission is to:</br>
1. Create a new flow from scratch. </br>
2. Build a Search API query to request information from Analyzer database and parse it into flow variables.</br>
3. Build a condition that matches use case scenario and route the call to agent.</br>

!!! Note
    We are going to touch Subflow which is the feature that enables easier management of complex flows by breaking down commonly used and repeated portions into reusable subflows. This improves readability of flows, increases reusability of repeated functionality in the subflow, as well as improves development time since there is no redundant design of the same flows.

    Subflows also introduce the ability to share commonly used subroutines between developers, between customers and will help unlock a library of subflows available in the marketplace.

## Testing

1. Your Agent desktop session should be still active but if not, use **Agent Desktop** with agent credentials you have been provided **<span class="attendee-id-container">wxcclabs+agent_ID<span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-prefix="wxcclabs+agent_ID" data-suffix="@gmail.com">Your_Attendee_ID</span>@gmail.com<span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**. You will see another login screen with OKTA on it where you may need to enter the email address again and the password provided to you. 
2. On your Agent Desktop, make sure your status is not set to **Available**
      1. Using Webex, place a call to your Inbound Channel number **<span class="attendee-id-container"><span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-suffix="_Channel">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_Channel<span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**
      2. After you hear the queue treatment start, you can abandon the call 
3. Using Webex, place another call to your Inbound Channel number **<span class="attendee-id-container"><span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-suffix="_Channel">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_Channel<span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**
4. On your Agent Desktop, set your status to available
      1. You should be offered a call, click on the accept button. (You may want to mute the mic on both Webex and the Agent Desktop)
      2. After a few moments end the call and select a wrapup code.
5. In your Flow:
      1. Open the Debugger
      2. Select the last interaction (at the top of the list)
      3. Trace the steps taken in the flow
6. Answer these questions:
      1. Was the call queued with priority?
         1. Why or why not?
7. Close the Debugger
8. Using Webex, place another call to your Inbound Channel number **<span class="attendee-id-container"><span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-suffix="_Channel">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_Channel<span class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**
9. On your Agent Desktop, set your status to available
      1. You should be offered a call, click on the accept button. (You may want to mute the mic on both Webex and the Agent Desktop)
      2. After a few moments end the call and select a wrapup code.
10. In your Flow:
      1. Open the debugger
      2. Select the last interaction (at the top of the list)
      3. Trace the steps taken in the flow
11. Answer these questions:
      1. Was the call queued with priority?
         1. Why or why not?
      2. If you called another Inbound Channel number with the same flow logic, would your call be prioritized?
         1. How could you change this behavior?
