#### Adding New Intents & Entities

In this step, we will learn how to add new intents and entities to enhance the bot's ability to understand and respond to a broader range of user inputs. These updates will be tested in both preview mode and during a live call to confirm that the bot correctly identifies the new intents and entities and provides appropriate responses.


1. While on the **Script** configuration page, switch to **Intents** tab and click on the **Create Intent** button located in the top right corner.
2. Add a new intent by providing the intent name as ***ReferralRequest***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="ReferralRequest"><span class="copy"></span></span> and include the following two utterances:

    - ***I would like a referral for a cardiologist.***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="I would like a referral for a cardiologist."><span class="copy"></span></span>
    - ***I need a referral to visit a neurologist.***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="I need a referral to visit a neurologist."><span class="copy"></span></span>

    ![Profiles](../graphics/AI_Track/AIScripted_AddUtterance.gif) 


3. Click on **+ Link** button on the right side under **Slots (optional)** and add **patient phone number** as an entity.

    >
    > Check the **Required** checkbox 
    >
    > Select the template key as **askPhoneNumber** from **Response** drop down, which will be used to prompt the patient for their phone number.
    

4. Again, click on **+ Link** and add **patient dob** (date of birth) 

    > 
    > Check **Required** checkbox
    > 
    > Select the template key as **askPatientDob**. When this intent is matched, it will trigger the Virtual Agent to ask the user to provide their phone number and date of birth for verification purposes.
