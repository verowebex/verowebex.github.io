## Story 

Callback functionality is an essential feature in a modern contact center, providing a solution that enhances both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

Imagine a customer calls to upgrade their service but faces a 20-minute wait, they can request a callback instead of staying on hold. If no agents are available, theyâ€™ll be offered the choice to remain in the queue or opt for a callback. Upon choosing the callback, they provide their number, which is validated, and the system schedules the call. Once an agent is free, the system connects with the customer. This ensures businesses retain leads while providing a seamless customer experience.


## Call Flow Overview

1. A new call enters the flow. </br>
2. The flow executes the logic configured in previous steps.</br>
3. The call is routed to the appropriate queue, but no agents are available.</br>
4. Since no agents are available, a callback option is offered to the caller.</br>
5. Once an agent becomes available, the callback is initiated to the provided number.</br>

## Mission Details

8. Validate the flow by clicking **Validate**, **Publish** and select the Latest version of the flow

    
## Testing
    
1. Make sure you're logged into the **Agent Desktop** as an Agent and set the status to **Not Available**. In this case, the call will not be assigned to an agent, and a callback will be proposed to the caller.
2. Make a call to the Support Number and if success you should hear configured messages.

3. When callback is proposed, press 1 on Webex App DialPad to request a callback. 

4. When asked, provide a new number for a callback. Because in the current lab we have number limitations, we are going to provide a well-known Cisco Worldwide Support contact number **1 408 526 7209**<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="+14085267209"><span class="copy"></span></span> as a callback number. Use the DialPad to provide the Cisco TAC number, then confirm when asked.
3. Once done, another message about successful scheduling should play.
4. Make your agent **Available**. Contact Center will reserve you right away and propose to answer a callback call.

**Congratulations on completing another mission.**
