## Story
Imagine calling a contact center, seeking quick, personalized help. Behind the scenes, a flow smoothly routes your call based on your needs.

### Call Flow Overview
1. A new call enters the flow. *(This initiates the interaction and triggers the defined call-handling process.)*
2. The flow determines the caller's language preference and plays a pre-configured Text-to-Speech (TTS) prompt. *(This ensures the caller receives information in their preferred language.)*
3. The call is routed to the appropriate queue. *(This directs the caller to the right team on the flow logic.)*

### Mission Details

Your mission is to:

1. Configure key flow elements for efficient caller journeys. </br>
2. Explore Flow Templates to streamline flow creation. </br>
3. Set up routing with conditions, such as language preference. </br>
4. Gain the skills to design flows for real-world scenarios. </br>

 **<details><summary>Why Flow Templates? <span style="color: orange;">[Optional]</span></summary>**
 Flow Templates in Webex Contact Center are an essential feature for flow developers, offering a range of benefits that streamline the development process and enhance the efficiency and consistency of flow creation. Here’s what they bring to the table:

  - **Consistency and Standards**: Templates ensure that flows adhere to best practices, creating consistent experiences across multiple projects.

  - **Time Savings**: Pre-built structures reduce the need to start from scratch, enabling faster setup and allowing more focus on customization.

  - **Reduced Errors**: Using tested templates lowers the risk of mistakes and minimizes troubleshooting.

  - **Easy Onboarding**: New developers or partners can learn quickly by using templates as guides.

  - **Scalability**: Templates allow developers to replicate and adapt solutions efficiently across different flows or deployments.

  - **Innovation**: Developers can spend more time on unique features and integrations rather than reconfiguring basics.

Flow Templates are designed to empower developers, speed up the development lifecycle, and maintain high-quality standards across flows, making them a core asset in Webex Contact Center flow design.
